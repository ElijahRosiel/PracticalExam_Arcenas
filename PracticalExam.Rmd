# 1.
NumOrInt <- sapply(warpbreaks, function(x) is.numeric(x) | is.integer(x))
NumOrInt

#Base on the result of the NumOrInt, Breaks is Numberic, While the Wool and Tension are both integers.

# 2.
#The result of NumOrInt gave 3 observations which is "[1:3] TRUE FALSE FALSE", Which indicates the warpbreak's column break as numeric, wool and tension as integers.

# 3.
#If needed to convert into integer I would have this code running as the break is already determined as a numeric

warpbreaks$wool <- as.integer(warpbreaks$wool)
warpbreaks$tension <- as.integer(warpbreaks$tension)

# 4.
#Displayed Error: NumOrInt <- sapplywarpbreaks, function(x) is.numeric(x) | is.integer(x))
#Error: unexpected ',' in "NumOrInt <- sapplywarpbreaks,"

#To get an error I removed the ( between the sapply and warbreaks which closes the command input for sapply, But I was confused about the , and realised that the error is having problems with the open command thus focused on what symbol is next. Which makes sense in my opinion
